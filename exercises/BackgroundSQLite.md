## History

<span >(WHEN and WHERE)
In the year 2000, Richard Hipp was working for a shipbuilding subsidiary of defense contractor General Dynamic in Maine (US)</span>

(THEN)
Hipp was building software for a battleship, which would operate on crucial data about the shipâ€™s valves

(PROBLEM)
The databse which they were using, Informix, stopped working whenever the server went down

(SOLUTION)
Hipp developed SQLite to solve this problem
The developed database was very compact, less than 250 kilobytes
SQLite as we know ito today, implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
