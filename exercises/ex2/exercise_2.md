1.  A company has a pool vehicle scheme where employees can use cars from the pool for business trips.  As a corporate benefit if the cars are not in use for business they are allowed to be used for personal trips, but business trips always take precedence.  

* Each car has make, model registration number and emissions information (for tax purposes).  
* Employees have name and belong to a department
* Employees must be previously registered to borrow a car and registration requires validation of the employees driving license.
* When an employee borrows a car the current odometer reading and the expected milage for the trip.
* When they return the car the exact millage is recorded along with any problems or damage to the car
* An employee can book a car out in the future if a car is available.  
* It should be possible for managers to see which people borrow the cars most often and do the most milage
* The fleet managers must be able to identify when each car needs a service.

Design a database model that would support this system.  


2.  Design a database to store THG's product catalogue.  

* Each product has a number of attributes, the attributes are dependant on the type of product
* All products have a set of product images
* Be sure to model products including clothes which have multiple sizes or are available in different colours/styles
* Some products have legal information that needs to be stored.  e.g. Food must have allergen information and hazardous products need have handling instructions for warehouse operations
* Some of attributes must be able to be stored in multiple languages
* Licensing, shipping restrictions and local laws mean that some products can only be sold to certain territories. 
* Pricing should be supported in multiple currencies and the same product can have different price on different website.
